[#upgrade]
=== Upgrade from Previous Releases

[#upgrade-defender]
==== Upgrade Defender Versions

With the v32.xx release, the https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/compute-edition/32/admin-guide/upgrade/support-lifecycle[supported (n, n-1, and n-2) Defender versions] are v32.xx, v31.xx, and v30.xx. Defender versions below v30.xx such as v22.12 cannot connect to the current version.

//To prepare for this update, upgrade your Defenders from version `v22.06` (Kepler) or earlier to a later version.

==== Upcoming Defender Obsolescence

With the upcoming v33.00 release, release v30.xx defenders will be obsolete. To prepare for this upcoming update, plan to upgrade defenders to release v31.xx or later.

[#upgrade-console]
==== Upgrade the Prisma Cloud Console

With the v32.xx release, the https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/compute-edition/32/admin-guide/upgrade/support-lifecycle[supported (n, n-1, and n-2) Console versions] are v32.xx, v31.xx, and v30.xx.  For example: for the current (n) major release v32.xx, the supported n-1 and n-2 versions are v31.xx and v30.xx respectively.

You can upgrade the Prisma Cloud Console from a major release to the next major release, but not to a major release that follows the next. So, to upgrade from the v30.xx release to the v32.xx release, you will have to first upgrade to  v31.xx and then upgrade to the v32.xx release.

|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

|*Enhanced Vulnerability Assessment*
//CWP-56841[Doc Ticket]CWP-48564[Eng Ticket]
//Moved from Update 4

|To enhance the accuracy of vulnerability assessments, Prisma Cloud has incorporated support for the 'Running On/With' configuration as outlined by NVD. This configuration, which integrates nodes based on both vulnerable and non-vulnerable criteria, requires specific conditions to be met, such as relevant packages or operating systems, for a vulnerability to be applicable. This enhancement allows Prisma Cloud to consider 'Running On/With' configurations that were not previously assessed. However, it is important to note that the impact of this enhancement is contingent on whether the CVE is assessed through NVD, as vulnerability information from the vendor feed is prioritized.

|*Serverless Defender support for Java 17 and 21*
//CWP-56785
|Added support for deploying Serverless Defender on Java 17 and Java 21 runtimes.

|*Cloud Account Management*
//CWP-55308
|Introduced the *Account Import Status* filter on the *Cloud Accounts* page in *Runtime Security*.
This feature includes three statuses:

* *Local accounts:* Cloud accounts created in Runtime Security only (and not in the Prisma Cloud console)
* *Manually imported accounts:* Cloud accounts that were manually imported from Prisma Cloud console to Runtime Security in the past prior to the Lagrange release (end of 2022)
* *Auto-imported accounts:* Cloud accounts that originated from Prisma Cloud console and seamlessly imported into Runtime Security.

//CWP-56554
|*Fixed Containerized Scan Failure*
|Resolved issue causing containerized scans to fail due to long scan data, particularly when encountering large Java dependency lists. You can now conduct scans without encountering this issue.

//CWP-56784
|*Improved Handling of Rejected and Disputed CVEs*
|With the transition to the CVE 5.0 dataset, NVD has updated the format of rejected CVE descriptions.
Prisma Cloud now seamlessly identifies 'Rejected' and 'Disputed' statuses of CVEs. In NVD the status is *now* labeled as 'Rejected reason', while CVEs tagged as 'Disputed' are identified using http://cve.org/[cve.org] data source, ensuring accurate vulnerability assessment.

//CWP-58016
|*Exported CSV does not include sam data across all asset types*
|Fix an issue where `risk factor` field was missed on Function and Host CSV results.
