== Satellite Deployment

Prisma Cloud Satellite is a lightweight and non-intrusive Kubernetes operator, which enables you to manage other Prisma Cloud applications lifecycle. Satellite automatically deploys the Discovery application, which is used by Prisma Cloud to ingest Kubernetes artifacts for analysis by CNA.

For the container exposure use case, Prisma Cloud correlates the Kubernetes configuration with the VPC network information to determine which Kubernetes services are internet exposed, the deployments and endpoints behind each service, and then builds a network graph to display the network path.

NOTE: The deployment of the Kubernetes Satellite operator across multiple namespaces within the same cluster is not supported. If you remove the Satellite operator from the Kubernetes cluster, the Kubernetes data that is ingested through that operator is immediately deleted.

//Added above Note based on CNS-9947 and CNS-10044

You can deploy Satellite manually or automated using the UI or the API.

[.procedure]

. Select *Settings > Providers*

. Click Connect Provider and select *K8s Satellite*.

. Enter the Cluster *Name* or Resource *ID* in the *K8s Cluster ID* dropdown.

. (Optional) Enter *Username* and *Password*.

. Click *Next*.
+
You can search the cluster by its name or the unique cluster asset ID by referencing the Cluster Asset ID field in the Prisma Cloud Asset Inventory page.

. *Review* the Cluster details and click *Next*.

. Copy the *Helm* upgrade/install command and execute it in your selected cluster.
+
NOTE: A unique identifier is created each time a Helm chart is generated and it acts as a cluster identifier, therefore you cannot reuse the helm chart across different clusters.

. As soon as the Helm chart is generated, the cluster will be in *Pending* state, until the Satellite gets deployed and starts reporting to Prisma Cloud. 
+
After the deployment is complete, the cluster state will change to *Active*. 
+
Once a cluster is in the Active state, it sends keep-alives to Prisma Cloud every 30 minutes. If there is a communication issue or if the Satellite gets removed, the object will move into an Offline state until the communication is re-established or the object is deleted on the Prisma Cloud console.
