== Investigate Kubernetes Network Exposure on Prisma Cloud

Use the `config from network where` queries, to investigate the *true* Network Exposure of a cloud resource.

//You can enter your query in the search bar and if the search expression is valid and complete, a green checkmark displays along with your query results. You can also use the auto-suggestion capabilities to write your queries.

You can also search for Kubernetes-related objects on *Investigate*. They are designed to be flexible in order to support a majority of use cases. The Network Path Analysis shows the path that network traffic would take if traffic were to be initiated from Source A to Destination B. Every hop in the path is a decision point in the traffic forwarding path in the cloud. 

//To further drill-down, click the *i* icon to get more information about routing-table configuration or security policy that is Allowing or Denying the traffic.

=== Container Exposure Graph
		
After the *Investigate* search displays the query results, click the *i* icon (Network Path) under Actions to view the detailed Network Path Analysis, which shows the path that the network traffic would take if traffic were to be initiated from the Source(Internet) to Destination (Kubernetes service and the endpoints). Every hop with a green bubble indicates the traffic can move forward (Allow traffic) from one point to the next. A hop with a red bubble indicates the traffic cannot move forward (Deny traffic).
