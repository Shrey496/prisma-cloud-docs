== Investigate Kubernetes Network Exposure on Prisma Cloud

Use the `config from network where` queries, to investigate the *true* Network Exposure of a cloud resource.

You can enter your query in the search bar and if the search expression is valid and complete, a green checkmark displays along with your query results. You can also use the auto-suggestion capabilities to write your queries.

You can also search for Kubernetes-related objects on *Investigate*. They are designed to be very flexible in order to support a majority of use cases. The Network Path Analysis shows the path that network traffic would take if traffic were to be initiated from Source A to Destination B. Every hop in the path is a decision point in the traffic forwarding path in the cloud.

To further drill-down, click the *i* icon to get more information about routing-table configuration or security policy that is ALLOW-ing or DENY-ing the traffic.
