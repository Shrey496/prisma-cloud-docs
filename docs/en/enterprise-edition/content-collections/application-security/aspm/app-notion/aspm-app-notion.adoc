== Application Notion

In CAS ASPM, Applications group artifacts like code repositories and containers into a single entity. This approach reduces the noise of security alerts by allowing you to focus on issues within the context of specific applications. You can define essential details for each application, such as its business impact. This empowers you to prioritize and remediate security issues related to the most critical aspects of your organization. By tracking metrics like resolved issues for high-impact applications compared to low-impact ones, you can assess the impact of each application on your overall security posture. This streamlined approach maximizes resource utilization and minimizes exposure to critical threats.
