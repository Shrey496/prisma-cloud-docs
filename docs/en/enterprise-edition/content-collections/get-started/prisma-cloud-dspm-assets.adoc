== Prisma Cloud Data Security Posture Management Supported Assets

The Prisma Cloud Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) solution, previously known as Dig Security platform, helps organizations discover, classify, protect, and govern their data across multi cloud environments. It is the first DSPM solution to support Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for image classification and a pioneer to provide data security for generative AI deployments. With Prisma Cloud DSPM, you can reduce data misuse, achieve compliance, and prevent ransomware attacks and data breaches.

Prisma Cloud DSPM metering depends on the type of data assets being secured. 

* For IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS data assets, DSPM requires 1 credit per data asset.
* For DBaaS assets, DSPM requires 1 credit per TB of data volume (i.e. size of the data asset).
