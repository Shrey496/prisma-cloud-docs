[#changes-in-existing-behavior]
=== Changes in Existing Behavior

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|*Feature*
|*Description*

|*Tag-based Resource Lists*
//RLP-140177

|Starting with the 24.7.2 release, the following limits will be enforced for Tag-based Resource Lists:

* Tag-based Resource Lists will be limited to 10 key-value pairs
* Up to 5 Tag-based Resource Lists may be associated with a Role
* Tag-based Resource List Tag key and value will be limited to 256 characters each

*Impact—* These changes will affect Tag-based Resource Lists and Roles after the 24.7.2 release. Existing configurations will not be affected.
// Commenting out per feedback from AO 5/24 - check for 24.7.1 inclusion

|*New Limits for Audit Log API*
//RLP-142211

|Prisma Cloud will introduce a response size limit of 100K records for the Audit Logs endpoint effective 24.7.1.

* https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/rl-audit-logs/[GET - /audit/redlock]


|*API Rate Limits — Update User Role API*
//RLP-141323

|To resolve a critical performance issue with the https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/update-user-role/[Update User Role] API (PUT /user/role), a rate limit with the following parameters will be implemented effective 24.7.1.

`Limit=3, Burst=3` 

*Impact—* Requests exceeding these limits will result in an *HTTP 429* Too Many Requests response.

|*Role-Based Access Control for Compliance and Alert Reports*
//RLP-140182

|User-generated reports will only be visible to System Administrators and to users with the same role effective 24.8.1.

Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enhances data security by streamlining report access for users with the same role, while also preventing unauthorized access.

[#new-policies]
=== New Policies

Learn about the new policies and upcoming policy changes for new and existing Prisma Cloud System policies.

==== Access the Look Ahead for New Policies

To learn about the new policies that will be added in the next release:


. Find the Prisma Cloud policies folder on GitHub.
+
The folder contains RQL based Config, IAM, Network, and Audit Event policies in JSON format. https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/prisma-cloud-policies[View the GitHub repo].

. Select the branch for which you want to review policy updates.
+
The *Master* branch represents the Prisma Cloud release that is generally available. You can switch to a previous release or the next release branch, to review the policies that were published previously or are planned for the upcoming release.
+
Because Prisma Cloud typically has 2 releases in a month, the release naming convention in GitHub is PCS-<year>.<month>.<release-chronology, 1 or 2>. For example, PCS-24.7.1.

. Review the updates.
+
Use the changelog.md file for a cumulative list of all policies that are added to a specific release. The policies are grouped by new policies and updated policies.
+
Use the *policies* folder to review the JSON for each policy that is added or updated as listed in the changelog. The filename for each policy matches the policy name listed in the changelog. Within each policy file, the JSON field names are described aptly to help you easily identify the characteristic it represents. The JSON field named searchModel.query provides the RQL for the policy.
